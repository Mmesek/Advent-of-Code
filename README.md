# Advent of Code
[![Open in Visual Studio Code](https://open.vscode.dev/badges/open-in-vscode.svg)](https://open.vscode.dev/Mmesek/Advent-of-Code)

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles alongside utility functions

Loads inputs from `/inputs` directory. Downloads directly from website when `cookie.dat` is specified

Running solution for current day/year:

```sh
python -m AoC
```

specifying `--day` and `--year` allows to run a different day/year than current calendar one
Additionaly, `--day` may contain optional suffix used for file resolution (Useful if there are multiple solutions for the same puzzle)
